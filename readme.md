# Maze Generator

## Description

This Python project allows you to generate random mazes using various algorithms. You can choose between different maze generation methods to create unique mazes.

## Features

- **Maze Generation Algorithms**: Choose between different maze generation algorithms to create randomized mazes.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Run the `main.py` script to launch the maze generator.

3. Choose a maze generation algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search or Prim's) and follow the on-screen instructions.

4. Enjoy exploring the randomly generated maze!

## Maze Generation Algorithms

This project offers different maze generation algorithms, including:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A simple recursive algorithm that generates mazes by randomly carving paths.

- **Prim's Algorithm**: A more complex algorithm that generates mazes by repeatedly removing walls at random.

## Dependencies

- Python 3+
- Turtle graphics library (included in Python standard library)

## License

This project is open-source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).

## Acknowledgments

- Special thanks to the Turtle graphics library for providing a fun way to visualize the maze generation process.
